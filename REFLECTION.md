## What made your assistant “personal” to you?
I picked the name Branden (who happens to be my older brother hehe) and the tasks based on my real week,
so it felt more connected to me.

## What challenges did you face using this?
Understanding how "this" works inside a methods kind of caught me off guard. Once I tested it, I 
started to get the idea

## Which method would you improve or expand?
I’d improve completeTask so it lets me choose which task to finish instead of just doing the first one.
